                                <p>Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous
                                    unique identifiers.
                                    These are sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on
                                    your device&#39;s

                                    However, they are
                                    obligated not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose.</p>
                                <h3>Security</h3>
                                <p>We value your trust in providing us your Personal Information, thus we are striving
                                    to use
